Don’t look at the date. Pretend it’s Saturday. Pretend it’s the day you need it to be. 

 

Optimism.

 

This was, honestly, a fantastic week.  I’m one of those people that consider Sunday that last day of the week. With that in mind, I hope to finish this one out strong. I’m also one of those people that believes in the idea that if I haven’t gone to sleep yet, it isn’t the next day. Today is still Saturday until I close my eyes. 

 

Closing my eyes feels like a chore sometimes. I need more hours in the day. I lose so much time to this incessant need for sleep. Why can’t I just do everything all at once? Why can’t I just skip forward to the end?

 

It’s not the destination that matters, but the journey.

 

Do not disregard the importance of the small stones that make up the pathway you walk to reach the temple. But keep your eyes ever forward, lest you lose interest in the glory of the sun.
