When I was 8 years old I wanted to be an archaeologist.
I would spend hour upon hour digging up "fossils" in the backyard of my childhood home.
I even distinctly remember attending a little league baseball game, seeing a large rock poking its head out of the dirt, and immediately searching for a stick to use to dig it up.
I loved the idea of digging up things from the past.
I hated being dirty, but would never let that stop me from getting that fossil out of the ground.
I would gladly get on my knees and dig with my bare hands if the situation dictated it.
For much of my youth, I fantasized traveling around the world with state-of-the-art gear and just digging.
I was an adamant believer that we should learn as much from our past as possible
Knowledge is the goal of discovery.
I still maintain that belief to this day.
My tools for digging up "fossils" have changed quite a lot over the years
My pick ax mind replaced the sharpened stick of my youth.
My dreams are no longer full of exotic digging sites; my dreams are now montages of people, interactions, and decisions.
I'm no longer laying belly down in the grass of the backyard studying the fossil I just unearthed, I'm standing tall with my face to the sun trying to catch a glimpse of perfection.
I'm not trying to live in the past.
I'm not attempting to apologize for my fossils.
I'm collecting them for data.
Knowledge is the goal of discovery.
Unlike my 8 year old self, I try to keep my hands clean these days.
I can't pretend I know everything and I can't pretend I don't know how to find the answer.
Just let me grab my tool bag.
