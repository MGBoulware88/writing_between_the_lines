The trees still have their leaves. It’s not autumn yet. At least, the fall has not yet started. Just enjoy the greenery while it lasts. 

 

Yet, it’s raining. It’s raining and raining and there really is no way to change that. Better, then, to focus more on what to do with all of this water than to curse the sky for it’s treachery.

 

It’s Friday, October 12th 2018. It isn’t Thursday, November 8th 2018, nor is it Saturday, October 19th, 2019. It’s today until it is tomorrow.

 

It will always be this way. There’s no way to control it. Just breathe. You’re doing fine :)
