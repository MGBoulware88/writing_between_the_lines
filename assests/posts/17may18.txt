Birds chirp in the distance as he waxes on and then waxes off again for what feels like the millionth time. “Some day I’ll be a great warrior,” he reassures himself. Of course, he doesn’t really like the tedious waxing on and off, but  c'est la vie, as they say.

 

“At least I’m not Sisyphus, condemned to push a boulder up a hill with no reward but the renewal of my quest to push a boulder up a hill. I am rewarded for my diligence with sunshine and fellowship and laughter. Every ounce of elbow grease is met with a warm smile. Every bead of sweat that rolls down my face is caught by the hand of a loved one.

 

And I tell you what. When I finally finish waxing on and off, this is gonna be one hell of a pretty car.”
