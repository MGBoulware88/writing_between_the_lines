I tell people I have bad knees sometimes. No one has ever picked up on the fact that I’m really just referencing that I fall a lot. I tend to land on my knees and create my own distressed jeans. Most of the time I just get up from a kneel, but sometimes I fall over completely and have to catch myself with my hands. 

 

For my next trick, I’ll start telling people about my bum wrist.

According to Taco Bell, we should all “Live MAS.” I don’t really know what that means. The Spanglish here is confusing. Live more? What does that even mean? I can’t be more alive. That’s a pass/fail check. Its a one or a zero. Its black or white. But, I’m Gray. Maybe, perhaps there’s more to it than that. Why don’t I look out a different lens for a second. The marketing team for a company the size of Taco Bell wouldn’t just willy-nilly make a new slogan that didn’t make any sense, right? Let’s just assume that. 

 

Live more. 

 

Learn more than 4 songs on the guitar.

 

Stop making excuses.

 

Make eye contact when you’re speaking.

 

Stop looking out the window and not seeing anything.

 

Find the time to take that fishing trip.

 

Stop being alone - unless you want to, then keep being alone.

 

Buy that Hot Wheels edition Camaro. :D

 

Stop waiting for the right moment. 

 

Tell her she’s beautiful.

 

Stop thinking about that mistake you made 12 days ago.

 

Look yourself in the eye and say “You got this, bro”

 

Don’t question your own abilities.

 

Live more.
