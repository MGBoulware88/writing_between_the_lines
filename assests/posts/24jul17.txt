Today sucked. Work sucked. Dinner sucked. Sucking sucks. I don’t feel creative today, so here’s an inspirational poem I wrote a long time ago:

 

 

 

“My Tree”

 

 

 

My tree has thick, brown bark

 

It is tough, but a sharp ax can best it

 

My tree has green leaves

 

They grow well when kissed by the sunlight, but I know they will eventually change color and fall away

 

My tree has deep roots

 

They nourish me, but a drought could leave them unsatisfied

 

My tree grows sky high

 

It has a tall, strong trunk, but a great gale could bend or break it

 

My tree has thick branches

 

My tree bears fruit
