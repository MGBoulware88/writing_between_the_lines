I couldn't sleep last night so I wrote a letter that I'll never send because no one sends letters anymore.

 

. . .

 

To whom it may concern,

 

I really like you. I think you're gorgeous and I really dig your personality. You seem to have strong family ties and you aren't one of those girls that is constantly on social media and texting everyone in their contacts list all day. Those are all things I find attractive. I really want to take you out on a proper date at a proper restaurant. We'll be the most beautiful people in the room having the greatest time. And after our spectacular dinner, I'll drive you home, kiss you good night and be on my way. After the awe of experiencing the greatest night a human has ever experienced in the history of civilization wears offs, I'll finally fall asleep. I'll dream of the fantastic fireworks show that played above our heads, and only our heads, during that good night kiss. I'll dream of the butterflies that have been dancing inside me since the first time I witnessed your smile.  I'll dream of how your hair fell perfectly to the side as to allow the table light do dance about your iris when you laughed. 

 

But you said you're not ready for a relationship. And I need to respect that. So I don't want to keep asking you out. That's not fair to you. It puts pressure on you and probably makes you feel uncomfortable - even if you want to say yes, but don't feel you are ready. I don't want you to finally give in to persistence; I want you to accept because you are ready to accept.

 

I'm not going anywhere. I'll keep asking how your day went and telling you you're beautiful. I'll keep my phone on in case you need to vent about your day. All you have to do is decide that you're ready for fireworks and butterflies and smiling so brightly that even the table light gets jealous and starts to dance in your eye in protest.

 

 

 

Sincerely,

 

Gray
