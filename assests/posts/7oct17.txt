There’s no traffic on 360 at 2. Why not go 110 on the way home? Why not get to my bed as fast as possible?

“If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy?”

 

 

 

. . .

 

 

 

What is life without love? What is love? Why have I never stopped to think about all that I’ve been missing? What is missing? I’ve been trying to focus on work and school, but maybe I’ve been leaving out a step. Maybe I forgot the part where I’m happy. 

 

Maybe I’m just drunk. Maybe I’m too honest when I’m drunk, My backspace key is getting worn down correcting all my typos. I’’ll leave a video.

“If our love’s insanity why are you my clarity?

 

You are the piece of me I wish I didn’t need. Chasing relentlessly. Still fight and I don’t know why.”
