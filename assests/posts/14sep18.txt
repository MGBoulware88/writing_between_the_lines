This week was great. I went to Florida for a few days for work. This weekend I have two toddler birthday parties to go to!

From Wikipedia:

 

A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. 

 

 

 

Go out and find that someone to share electrons with. If it’s not electric, then it’s not worth the effort. Go find the Eve to your atoms and form a covalent bond.
