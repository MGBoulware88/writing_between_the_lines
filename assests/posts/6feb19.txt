We planted an oak tree in the front yard of the house I grew up in in Saginaw. I remember going to the store with my family and browsing the nursery to pick one out. I think I was somewhere between 12-15 when we planted it. I used to go check on it to see the progress, but it was never much of a noticeable growth. It turns out that trees grow very slowly.

 

 

 

It’s not just a slow growth. It’s a steady, strong one. It takes a certain amount of time to build a big, strong tree. You can’t, and shouldn’t attempt to, shortcut that process. If you really can’t wait for the tree to flower, you can supplement your garden by planting flowers in the bed. But don’t let this fool you into thinking you’ve now created a strong foundation. This is merely a vanity to please you while wait for your tree to grow and sprout its beautiful flowers.

 

 

 

I checked out that house on Google Earth recently. The tree is so big and beautiful now.
