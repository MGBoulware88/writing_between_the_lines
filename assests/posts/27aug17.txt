Melody: Why do you even like me, Daxter?

 

Daxter: How much time do you have?

 

Melody: Besides just my appearance or smile.

 

Daxter: Melody, I like you for so much more than just your beautiful smile. I genuinely enjoy talking to you everyday. You have a great personality, and I feel like I’ve only just caught a glimpse of it. I really like that you appear to be good with kids. I can tell you are smiling when you talk about your family and their kids. I really like your ambition. It’s easy to coast through a routine, but that’s not good enough for you. You don’t want good enough, you want better.

 

Melody, there is so much more to you than I could ever capture with words in a single lifetime.  I really like that you motivate me to be the best version of myself just by existing. The first time I looked into your eyes I knew I would need to push myself ever harder if I wanted to capture the affection of this beautiful melody. 

 

And you, beautiful Melody, are worth the time and effort.
