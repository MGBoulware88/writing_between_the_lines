There’s a song by the band Brand New called “I Will Play My Game Beneath the Spin Light” that I always go back to (and by that I obviously mean that I sing the shit out of this in the shower). In the second verse, there’s a line that pulls at me: “Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic, but I am payed to make girls panic while I sing. . .” The song itself is, simply put, about being obligated to be on the road to play songs. But I think this line sums up the entire tone of the song. The writer is acknowledging the fact that they have a job to do. They’re feeding into the expectations that have been set for them. The people expect the band to blow their minds on stage, so they do. It doesn’t matter what the individual members of the band want, they have a duty to the people. 

 

I need to be more like Brand New. I need to fulfill my obligations by meeting the expectations of the people. I need to miss “home.” I need to reminisce about the smells of summer and the cool breeze blowing through my hair (hah). I need to stand up and get on stage even when all I want to do is anything but.
