I find myself looking up at the sky a lot less scarcely than I’m used to. My neck has become sore because I’m not used to this posture. 

 

“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll still have landed among the stars.” Some iteration of this was on at least one classroom every year when I was growing up. At first when I saw it, I found it repulsive. What kind of message is this? My consolation prize for failing is to be among stars? There are so many stars. Stars aren’t special. 

 

“Pfft,” I would say to myself. “Pfft, what a stupid message - I would never settle for a consolation star.” As the years went by and I stopped wasting energy on hating this ridiculous poster, I inadvertently lowered the drawbridge for its doctrine to infect my thoughts and modify my perceptions of what an accomplishment is. 

 

A new regime was born. I no longer fancied the moon. I no longer scoffed at the implication that it was okay to misalign my shots if there was still a reward for not winning. I forgot that that prize wasn’t worth winning. I forgot to covet the moon.

 

. . .

 

 

 

“When hope is fleeting, stop for a moment and visualize, in a sky of silver, the crescent of a lavender moon. Imagine it -- delicate, slim, precise, like a paper-thin slice from a cabochon jewel.

 

It may not be very useful, but it is beautiful.

 

And sometimes it is enough.” -Vera Nazarian
