New Year Resolution #2: Write more.
Mother,
There's a monster underneath my bed,
Mother.
There is no monster,
Son,
Stop making excuses and get out of bed.
Mother,
If I get out of bed the monster will get me,
Mother.
I don't see any monsters,
Son,
Stop making things up and get out of bed.
Mother,
I can't put my feet on the gound,
Mother.
You're an adult,
Son,
Act like an adult and get up.
Mother,
I can't leave this bed with the monster here,
Mother.
The doctor says the monster is real,
Son,
Take these pills and it will go away
Mother,
The monster is no longer underneath my bed,
Mother.
Now that we fixed that,
Son,
It is time to act like an adult.
Mother,
I can get out of bed now.
Mother,
I can walk around my room now.
Mother,
These pills make me feel weird.
The monster is gone,
Son,
Stop complaining.
Mother,
I don't like taking these pills.
Mother,
There has to be a better way to conquer the monster,
Mother.
I don't understand you,
Son,
Why would you refuse help?
Mother,
I will learn to escape the monster.
Mother,
I will push through when it grabs my leg.
Mother,
I will leave this bed of my own volition,
Mother.
You need to take your pills, 
Son,
You can't beat the monster on your own forever
Mother,
I don't have to beat the monster forever.
I just have to beat it today.
