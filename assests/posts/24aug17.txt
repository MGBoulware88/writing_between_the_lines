Tomorrow is my birthday bash. My actual birthday is another week away, but I won’t be in town the following weekend, so this weekend will do. And what an amazing week it has been.

 

I got that amazing job I was super excited about interviewing for. I was immediately offered the job after they called my references to make sure I’m not a crackpot. Even better than that, the recruiter told me that, after meeting with me Monday morning, they canceled the interview they had scheduled for Tuesday!  I am beyond excited to start working for this company. 

 

I am, however, going to be sad to leave the lab. I’m not sure if this is the correct analogy, but it feels an awful lot like my child is leaving for college. I know it’s the best decision in the long term, but I don’t want them to leave. I’m not crying, you’re crying.

 

Speaking of college, my start date got delayed until October first. Apparently, someone in the admissions department very conveniently left out the part about me needing to request a transcript from the CCAF until 3 days before I needed all the paperwork in order to start 1 September. Something about it being a VA requirement in order to disperse my GI Bill benefits. It takes roughly 30 days from the request date for the CCAF transcript to be delivered. I’m still cutting it close, but hopefully WGU receives it by 15 Sep so I can start 1 Oct.

 

It ended up working out better this way. I’m heading to Houston next weekend to install some software for a lab down there. It would have been really awkward timing to start my classes the same weekend I’m out of town. I’ve been planning in my head 1-3 hours a day M-F and 6-8 hours on the weekends once class starts, but that wouldn’t be realistic while out of town working.
