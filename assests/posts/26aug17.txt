I wish I was so much better with my words. I get so flustered sometimes. Something about that smile just folds my tongue in a way that it just doesn’t work right anymore. Sometimes, I wish that I could appreciate the sunset more. Most times I don’t. I would have to take back meeting you if I wanted to do that.

I’m gonna stop walking so fast. I’m gonna stop and wait for you to catch up. I don’t mind waiting. I don’t mind waiting at all. 

 

I know I walk too fast. I need to stop walking so fast.

I had a great time at my birthday bash. Thanks to everyone who came out.
