The quest for goodness, while arguably noble, is so frustratingly impossible. How can one possibly succeed at something that is negated by an error of the smallest margin? 1 standard deviation in the wrong direction ruins every right one. How apropos that it’s raining today - the weather always does seem to match my mood. 

 

You know, it’s true what they say: the path to hell really is paved with good intentions. Trying to do the right thing and being wrong about it is still damning. You don’t have to be evil to be a dumbass and ruin someone’s day. I guess I just don’t learn fast enough \_(- _ -)_/

 

Maybe I should quit while I’m not that far behind yet. Maybe goodness really is a pipe dream and I’ve just never really had an interest in smoking crack. Maybe I’m too easily discouraged. No matter how wet the trees get or muddy the yard gets, they are no less vibrant and green. Maybe it will stop raining tomorrow. Probably not.
