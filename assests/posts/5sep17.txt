My first day at the new company went pretty well.  I got all the passwords I need and took a look at some network diagrams and closed out a few tickets. This place is a far cry from my previous gig. Whatever unpleasant feelings I had about leaving evacuated my mind as soon as I clenched my teeth into this new hunk of meat. I’m going to be so much happier here at this much better organized company.
