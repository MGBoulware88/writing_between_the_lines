I worry a lot that I’m wasting my time. Efficiency has been tattooed onto my bones, probably from my brief stint in the military. I can’t help but want to be as efficient as possible with all available resources. When I think I spent my time the wrong way, it bugs me for days. I eat less, I sleep fewer hours, and I drink more coffee. I do love coffee, but hands can only be so jittery and still manage to peck the right keys on the keyboard. 

 

The unsteadiness I feel is, at first, from calculating, over-analyzing, and reiterating those hours in question. I have to be sure. I must remove all other variables to leave the smallest margin of error. What could I have done differently? Was the entire thing a waste or did I make a mistake somewhere that led me to feel like those butterflies that once fluttered in my stomach all died and somehow became so immensely heavy that my stomach had no other option but to sink into my gut?

 

Above all else, I value learning. What good is an experience if I can’t learn from it? Good or bad, I try to learn from everything and everyone. I keep telling myself that I’ll eventually learn everything and things will be easier. But I’m probably lying. I’m probably coercing myself into pursuing knowledge that doesn’t matter, knowledge that doesn’t exist, and knowledge that isn’t easy to digest.

Have you ever met someone with such profound beauty that you forgot the sunset? I have. The problem isn’t that you forget the sunset really, the problem is that you can no longer call it beautiful. It isn’t the right word. There is just no way I could call the sunset beautiful and compare it to her smile.  When people around me say “whoa, look at the sky! What a beautiful sunset,” I respond in kind: “Yeah, it’s okay.”
