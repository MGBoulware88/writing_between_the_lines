This ‘Festival of Hands’ as I’ve come to call it now

 

Marks the beginning of Spring as this Winter now ends

 

Some of the women curtsy, and most of the men bow

 

But everyone who comes is of the rock’s dearest friends

 

“I vow to always be there when you need a helping hand”

 

 

 

Most who come  to the festival don’t need travel far

 

They remain close by the rock for a winter too strong

 

These are the Elders who maintain the rock’s reservoir

 

To support the hands that travel far to join the throng

 

“I vow to always be there when you need a helping hand”

 

 

 

I  heard a tale that the rock shines brightly in the sun

 

But it’s only after the festival has begun

 

“I vow to always be there when you need a helping hand”
