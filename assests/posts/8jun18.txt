Who cares? Don’t even start it up again. I won’t have it.

I miss your face. I miss the way the light would dance off your eyes as you said “hi.”

 

I take it back. I’ll never talk to any one else ever again. I don’t need words. Just your smile. Your smile will suffice for the rest of my days. And your eyes. I want to see them in candle light. Or a campfire-light. 

 

I would even take fluorescent lighting just to see them again. I really do like green. I tell everyone that my favorite color is purple. Plum purple is such a great color and it really complements my blue eyes; but, really, green is a great color, too.

(“Sorry” by Nothing but Theives)

 

. . . 

 

 

 

Maybe I’m defective or maybe I’m dumb. I’m sorry, so sorry for what I’ve done.

 

Maybe I’m bad natured or maybe I’m numb. I’m sorry, so sorry for what I’ve done.

 

 

 

. . .

 

 

 

Can’t we just be honest? I’ve no idea what I’m doing. I always want to be kind and fair. I don’t always understand the nuanced consequences of my decisions. Maybe I’m still an adolescent or maybe I just don’t learn as fast as I thought I did.  

 

I’m sorry, so sorry for what I’ve done.

Have you ever walked down a street that you’ve walked down many, many times before and just thought “when did that tree get planted?” Or maybe you saw a new stone or plant in someone’s garden that you’d seen so many times before and thought to yourself “when did they put that there?” 

 

The point is that it doesn’t matter; the ‘when’ never matters. All that matter is the ‘what’ that you see. 1 or 0. There either is or there isn’t. There doesn’t actually ever seem to be any gray areas - even though we were so often forced to read and analyze them as children.

 

One or Zero. It’s your choice, mate.
