Guys, holy shit. July is starting off with a bang. Obviously, July 4th was awesome because smoked brisket. Then, we had a “Muffins & Mimosas” event at the office on Friday (side note:  apparently I really like mimosas).

 

This past weekend I did something I thought I would never do in a million years: I went to a birthday party for someone I have never met. This party was hosted and masterminded by someone I had never met in person! And it was the best decision I have made in a long time. Every one there was awesome and it was probably the best birthday event I will ever go to (that isn’t my own birthday event). 10/10

 

Which reminds me - my 30th is coming up faster than I would like. I think I’m gonna hire a professional party planner and just go super ham for it. Let’s make it the best night that I’ll never remember.

 

Speaking of remembering things. Did you know that elephants can maybe actually jump, but they never do because their own weight would crush their legs as they landed? Remember that next time you make fun of an elephant for not being able to jump while you lick Cheetos off your fingers.
