I’m still holding back - holding back the words, holding back the tears. I like to blame it on dry contacts, but I always feel like I’m one missed laugh away from watery eyes. It’s so annoying to not be happy. Unrealized ambition and naturally low serotonin will do that, I guess. But I’m still on the right path. I’ll try again at the next town. 

 

 

 

. . .

 

I’m gonna get another tattoo on my left forearm. I may form it into a three quarter or full sleeve in the future. 

 

Don’t let the failures of yesterday prevent you from trying again tomorrow.
