It’s Thursday, the day after Chicken Fried Steak Day. And the day before Friday. When you frame it like that, then it does sound quite poor. Is Thursday the new Monday? 

 

 

 

. . .

 

 

 

Don’t fall over. It’s okay to trip, but try to catch yourself. 

 

And when you forget that all is not lost, thinking there is no reason to move forward; and when you forget that you are not small, thinking there is no value you can provide; and when you forget that you are worth loving, thinking there’s no one who will miss you if you disappear. 

 

Let me remind you:

 

There is.

 

Really, you should have learned all the traps by now. You shouldn’t be falling in the same holes. Stop staring at the sun and dreaming about tomorrow. No one believes you when you say you are just testing out your new sunglasses. 

 

Stop blaming everything else. Learn from everything you can.

 

And when you forget that you don’t have to live like this, thinking everyone carries this around; and when you forget that you are the only you, thinking nothing makes you special; and when you forget that there’s nothing wrong with pretending to talk in the third person, thinking there’s no harm in constantly wearing a mask. 

 

Let me tell you:

 

There is.

 

Don’t be scared to grow. Different doesn’t equal danger. Ignore you brain’s primordial impulses. Repulsion is natural if there’s no safe pattern to follow.

 

Make the pattern. Don’t tell me there’s no justification for breaking the mold.

 

There is.
