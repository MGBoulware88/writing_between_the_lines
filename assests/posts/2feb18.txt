It’s been a while, I know. Welcome back. I needed to change my routine and I didn’t think I could maintain the quality I demand without greatly decreasing the quantity. It’s better in the long run. You’ll thank me later.

I remember being a kid and grown-ups asking me that silly, old question of "What do you want to be when you grow up, sport?" As if I somehow had this great insight into my own strengths and weakness and how best to apply that to a career. Although, I would always give them the same answer: "I'm going to be an Archaeologist when I grow up!" People outside of my close family who hadn't heard this before would always exclaim at my response. "Wow, that's great," or "Gosh, what makes you want to be an Archaeologist, tiger?" My scripted answer was always some version of "I love digging up fossils!" or "I find the past really fascinating, Uncle Jim!" Most people would play along and tell me that was a a great idea. That I was so smart I could do anything I wanted to when I grew up. Others would interject that I should be a Doctor or a Scientist because I'm so smart. I think they were trying to give me a compliment, but I just thought they were idiots. Shrug. You can't go around asking children questions about themselves and then tell them that their answer is wrong.

 

I didn't realize how fitting this metaphor would be until I was in my 20s. Well, the 20. When I was in the Air Force I had my, up to this point, hardest event of my life. Simultaneously, I encountered betrayal, rejection, and inadequacy. Now, I had a pretty smooth adolescence. I think the worst thing that happened to me was my friends went camping without me? Yeah, pretty heavy stuff there. I didn't really have anything to struggle with past sports and homework. I wasn't ever exposed to loss, or great stress, or anything much at all. Mr. Sheltered, reporting for duty!

I didn't immediately realize how bad I was at coping with things until others intervened.I couldn't understand why it was so hard for me to move on and take a shower. That wasn't a metaphor - getting out of bed to take a shower was out of the question. It caused so much dissonance. I'm Gray MF Boulware, the Chosen One - life is easy. This can't be real life. There has to be a mistake somewhere. I started searching for one. I got my shovel out and started digging. I must have gone over every text message, every conversation on the phone, every long good-bye a hundred times. I didn't find anything there, so I had to go even further back. I started iterating on everything I had ever done. What if I had done it this way? What if I had said this instead? What if I had said nothing? Why can't I figure out the answer? I was stumped. I'd never been stumped before. It was infuriating. I'm Gray MF Boulware, the Chosen One, but I don't know why that doesn't work anymore.

 

I just wanted to lock myself away until I could come up with an answer. I didn't expect anyone to understand, but I couldn't do with the distraction  from my true mission. I feared that if I never understood why this happened and why it was so hard to forget, I would go crazy. But I nearly drove myself crazy in my hapless pursuit of the unknowable.

I ended up going to the base Psychologist so that he could assess my mental state. While I was in the waiting room, I had to fill out this questionnaire about my emotional levels. "On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your depression level?" I figured, yeah, I feel pretty shitty so I should put a high number here. I went with 9. The next question was "On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your anxiety level?" I legitimately had no idea how to answer this question. What did this mean? How do I assess my anxiety level if I don't know what anxiety is? I was so naive that I didn't even understand my own mind. I just took a guess and figured that since I didn't know what it was, it must not apply to me, but it would look suspicious to put 1 (perfect logic). I went with 2. Ironically, I had a lot of anxiety about seeing the Doctor.

 

In the beginning, I had a lot of trouble talking to the Doctor. I'd just been crushed so hard for letting my walls down, it wasn't easy for me to lower them again. Luckily for me, he was really good with a grappling hook - I was fully exposed by the end of the session. The part that still, to this day, stands out to me about him was how human he was. I had so much anxiety building up in the waiting room. I had all these crazy ideas in my head: fear, embarrassment, hostility, angst. I expected to meet with him and be studied, or examined, or researched. Nope, he just talked to me like an old friend. It was this, most of all, that sharpened his knife. Once he had my guts on the floor it was a very fast diagnosis. I didn't want to be there, but I knew I needed help. The Doctor being so easy to talk to made it almost comfortable for a moment.

  His diagnosis of severe depression and anxiety disorder sent my stomach to the floor. I lost all the air in my body and just slithered out of my chair. Ironically, it was the anxiety that spiked in that moment. I came here to find out why I couldn't get out of this slump of constantly punishing myself over the mistakes I'd made in the past. I wanted him to remind me how to laugh and smile. But now all I could think about was what happens next. How does tomorrow play out? How many things can go wrong when I take these documents back to my Commander? Everyone in the Squadron knows where I went - how can I look them in the eye and carry on small talk at the gazebo without revealing my shame? There was a small amount of relief that came out of this. At least I now knew that it wasn't completely my fault. My happiness levels are naturally lower than normal so events that cause a drop in that send mine lower than expected. Also, I was totally right about being an Archaeologist (go me?). One of the symptoms used to classify depression is obsessive thoughts of the past. Yup, pretty much nailed that one. +10 points to Ravenclaw!

 

After that, I mostly tried to keep to myself without giving the appearance of seclusion. Sometimes people would stop by my dorm room, but I didn't appreciate their pity or obligation visits. There was this one girl who was really into muscle cars like me that would come hang out sometimes. I think she even changed a bulb on my Trans Am for me once. She was tolerable. I just needed to get myself into a cycle. I needed to be Work Gray from 0730 to 1700. After that I could be me; after that I could find shelter and feel the warm embrace of my single unit dorm room. The fridge was always stocked with beer, nature's medicine. So I put on my mask and took my place on the assembly line. I was learning how to fake it, and it was working. I still found the most comfort in my bed, but it was easier to get out of it. Until it wasn't.

Fast forward about 5 years. I'm a civilian now. Living at my parents' house. Still haven't accomplished anything with my life. Dissonance, again. I struggled so much with my own shame of failure. I was this genius kid with so much potential. I still couldn't wrap my head around how I got here. I had to take out my tools and do some digging. I stayed up all night, every night, examining the events of my past that lead up to this moment. I wasn't getting anywhere. I mean that in every sense of the word. I wasn't getting any answers from my research, I wasn't really getting out of bed anymore, and I damn sure wasn't moving forward with my life. I needed to get the assembly line up and running again, but I couldn't do that from this house. So I left. I literally just packed a small duffel bag, got in my car, and drove off. I ended up at a buddies place, who agreed to let me crash there.

I don't think he had any idea how important that was for me. I'm not exaggerating when I say he saved my life. I went from 0-100 pretty quickly while couch surfing at my friends' places. What a game changer. Realizing I had this immense amount of support was humbling, comforting, and absolutely amazing. I don't think I was willing to let anyone help me before this. Maturing is weird. I learned so much in the year or so after that about myself and how to manage daily life with depression and anxiety, but it wasn't quite enough yet. I wasn't there yet. 

 

I'm a lot older than I was when I reveled without a care, but I still remember why I did it - pure adolescent naivety. I had enough arrogance and ignorance to just smile and laugh and dance whenever I wanted to. It was starting to cross my mind that it might actually be okay to do that sort of thing again.

I got to the point where I was trying to convince myself that there was nothing wrong with me. I would trick myself into thinking that I had just had my first taste of life and wasn't prepared for it. That's all - my reaction was totally normal for a noob. Now that I've bounced back from that setback, I will be fine. I don't need to maintain anything or check up on myself to make sure I'm doing okay. I totally got this now. I've learned from my mistakes in the past, I have a support network, I have a decent job now. I don't have to wear this mask anymore. I'm Gray MF Boulware, the Chosen One - and I'm back, baby! I'm ready to reclaim my throne.

Things were "great" for a while, I suppose. I use quotations because I don't believe that. Things weren't great if compared to how I envisioned myself at 25 when I was 15, but they were decidedly better than before. I was doing okay for a while by pure luck. I wasn't even trying. I tried to use some over-confidence, arrogance, voodoo magic to counteract instead of, you know, something useful. Let's put some money in the bank. Let's buy a new car and some new clothes. Let's play pretend. Everyone is so concerned with appearance so let's show them what they want to see. I live alone, I can just start self-medicating with booze again.

 

I don't have to tell you that this was a terribly misguided plan of action. My normal therapy of distraction wasn't working anymore, but this was not a good backup plan. I needed to stop with bandages and suture the wound properly. Sure, okay, I know I can't just fix this and have it go away. I'll admit there are some things that even the Chosen One can't do, but maybe I can find the roots. I am pretty hecking good with a shovel by now. I'm not going on medication. I need the full capacity of my brain, even if it is tainted.

I know what I'm doing now (at least, much more so than I did a few years ago). I have a good routine. I have a good amount of control over my state and understand better the triggers I need to avoid. Which reminds me, please just don't ever call me unless you are like dead or something. Thanks. 

 

I've established a 5-year plan to buy a house. I'm working on [I've established a 5-year plan to buy a house. I'm working on [redacted]. I probably shouldn't talk about work, though. Trade secrets and all that. It's coming along. I'm  coming along. I'm enjoying things; I'm learning; I'm growing. I'm remembering that it's okay to smile and laugh and dance. It's also okay to not do those things all the time.

 

And I'm singing.

I'm singing just because I want to. Washing my hands? Let's belt out the first verse and chorus of Ghostman on Third. 

 

I'm singing because I love to. Driving to work? Let's turn the radio off and throw down some acapella Hallelujah.

 

I'm singing because it feels good. Feeling down? Let's open Spotify and jam out.

 

I'm singing because it allows me to express myself without feeling vulnerable. There's nothing more honest than a tear fallen during a chorus. There's nothing more uplifting than a smile triggered by a melody - the kind that gives you goosebumps and sends a chill down your spine. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then stop listening to mumble rap and canned pop songs. Sing. Don't just hum along in the car. I've already learned this lesson so you don't have to: you can't just fake it. You actually have to sing.

I still think about the past sometimes. I sometimes wish I could go back and change my answer. I like to replay those moments in my head and change the dialogue to something like:

 

"Well, whatcha wanna be when you're growed up, kiddo?"

 

"I'm going to be an Astronaut, Crazy Cowboy Bill!" 

 

"Hee haw! Whatcha wanna go an' do that for?

 

"I didn't say I wanted to, Crazy Cowboy Bill. I said I'm going to. It's my destiny to reach the stars and not look back."

 

"Well, you shore seem confident, sport"

 

"I'm Gray MF Boulware, the Chosen One. They will remember me."
