I always get nostalgic around my birthday. Something about assigning a number to my identity highlights the amount of time that has passed since I last reflected on it.  I learned an absolutely massive amount this year; I climbed a bunch of mango trees;  I met an enormous array of new faces; I bid farewell to too many. 

 

There’s a song in the musical “Rent” that asks a question about how to measure a year. It even tries to offer up some answers. But, as the song goes, “how do you measure a year?” Their answers don’t matter. How do _you_ measure a year? I measure mine in laughter and tears. I measure my year in learning and growth. I measure my year the same way I measure my coffee: how much did I drink? I measure my year in smiles and hugs and kisses.

 

By my calculations, this was a great year.
