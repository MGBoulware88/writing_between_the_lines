The Bornean Keeled Pit Viper is a beautiful, venomous snake native to SE Asia (Borneo). I can’t help that I’m drawn to the gorgeous cream color of its scales, with the accents of blue-green and turquoise horizontal bands. It’s easy to forget about the heat-sensing pits on the sides of its head, or the venom hiding in its kiss.

 

I wonder at times if it would be worth the risk to try to find one and acclimate it to my environment. It’s possible I could make it feel comfortable enough that it would not feel threatened by me. I would not need to fear its venom if I did not fear its fangs. 

 

But, then I remember that, no matter how attractive or alluring I find them, Pit Vipers have only 2 modes: rest & attack. So I decide to stop wasting time being enchanted by the impossible friend. There are plenty of other snakes in the jungle. I’ll try to find one I fancy that isn’t toxic.

Always look forward. Don’t look back except to help those behind. Never browse the aisles.
