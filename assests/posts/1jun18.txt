Stop looking down. Stop looking down at your phone. Stop looking down at your shoes. Stop looking down. Keep your chin parallel to the floor. If you’re sitting at a table or a desk, then keep it parallel to that. Just stop looking down all the time. You’re missing the flowers; you’re missing the romance; you’re missing the beauty. 

 

And all that sunshine lost, deflected off your head into the walls. Why wouldn’t you want the sunlight to brighten up your face? It’s so grand to see the light reflect off of your eyes. Look out the window sometimes. There’s more beauty outside than you could ever find alone in your office. The Internet is vast, but it can’t replace the heartbeat of the new friend you never made because you never stopped staring at your phone.

It’s really hard to bounce back after such a dumb feat. I always strive for greatness. I only want people to be happy and smile. I try my hardest to be compassionate and kind. But sometimes I mess up. Sometimes, I confuse my own needs as forgivable by those around me. I can’t always understand the difference between instinct and indecent. It’s not a conscious decision to do harm. That may actually be worse than neglect. If I neglect to take into account others’ feelings, desires, wishes, is that less damning than completely understanding the situation and then choosing the same path?

 

I’m still not sure. I am sure that I make the wrong decisions constantly and push people I care about away. I am sure that I still have no idea what I’m doing. I am sure that I am good at my job. I am sure that I have much to learn.
