You may think it strange that I read the technical specifications in the User Manual that came with my toaster. But, if I have company over and they comment on my toaster setting of 2.25, then I need to be able to immediately respond with "Based on the surface area of the coils and the consistent heat output from 1200 Watts, I've found that the duration setting of 2.25 provides the best output of semi-crisp, semi-browned toast." To which of course they would reply "You are my soul mate."
And that's how babies are made.
