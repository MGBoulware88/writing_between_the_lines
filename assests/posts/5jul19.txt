It’s strange how a single person can fundamentally change how you perceive the world. Like looking through a kaleidescope, everything around you that your brain is receiving sensory input for is somehow distorted. But it is so wholly distorted that it becomes the new normal and you can no longer tell the difference between the kaleidescope world and the one you used to know. You know the sky isn’t actually blue. Somewhere in your brain you can still hold on to this fact as you gaze upwards towards the sun and see all the blue light scattered about in our atmosphere. 

 

But I remember it being a truer shade of blue before. This sky has more gray in it than I think it should. I think it’s here, this dissonance, that makes it possible for logic to win. Once you realize what you see is wrong it becomes possible to pull away from the kaleidescope and refresh your perspective. Introspection can open your eyes to the cracks and flaws and distortions you’ve grown accustomed to. It’s almost like an epiphany, but not just a single idea - all the ideas, all at once. A flood of hormones jolting you awake as you realize the sky really does have a pretty, blue hue if you look at it just right. 

 

And the air starts to smell cleaner again. The bustling of the city isn’t so frustratingly noisy - it’s the joyful bumbling of the neighbors. I made a lemon garlic chicken in my crock pot this week. It was delicious and refreshing.  I paired it with some basmati rice that I cooked with some butter and a little, tiny bit of basil. The fresh cut green beans I got from Whole Foods completed the meal exceedingly well. My mouth is watering thinking about it right now.  

 

I did get pretty badly sunburned last weekend, but I’m not going to let that stop me from going outside again.
