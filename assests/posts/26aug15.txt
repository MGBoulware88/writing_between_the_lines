We spend our childhood painting murals of these infallible giants.
Never seeing the great chasm that exists between reality and farce.
Stones rolling downhill gather no moss in our minds.
Delicate brush strokes allow us to romanticize the art.
Of painting the picture we want to see
Instead of fixing the one drawn already.
In grandiose illusions we create of ourselves
We always move forward and never fall down.
Well, I think - I think, if you've never fallen then you've never pushed yourself.
And if you ever want to fly you're going to have start running a whole lot faster
But maybe flight is not what we're all after
Maybe not every one you meet is longing for a birds eye view
Some people just want to have green grass.
Some people just need to not be last.
