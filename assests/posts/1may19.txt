“Last year I needed change of pace. Couldn’t take the pace of change - moving hastily. But this year, though I’m far from home, in trench I’m not alone. The faces facin’ me they know what I mean.”

When are you supposed to say stop? When is it okay to scream at the hills that you won’t put up with their shit any longer? Their eyes are piercing, their intentions are without honor. The times of silent protest have ended. The bourgeois shall seize the means of production. The regime shall be overturned by the morning.

My favorite moments of late are when introspection leads to revelation and epiphany. 

 

Have you ever been angry at a clock? What about a calendar?

 

Why? Is it because you blinked and the calendar pulled a fast one on you? Or is it because you paused and realized you were 30 and weren't a millionaire yet? You didn’t do the thing you thought you would have done by 30 when you were a kid? That’s entirely your fault. You should just accept it now. You hold the keys that unlock the doors you walk though. Don’t blame someone else. Don’t blame something else. Better people have conquered far greater obstacles than the ones you are mumbling at the screen right now.

“The burning is so low it’s concerning. ‘Cause they know that when it goes out it’s a glorious gone. It’s only time before they show me why no one ever comes back with details from beyond.”

“ Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. 
 Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. 
 It is our light, not our darkness
 That most frightens us. “

 

 

 

 . . .

 

There truly is nothing enlightened about staying dim as to not outshine your peers for fear of causing them feelings of inadequacy. 

 

Don’t shrink.

 

Grow.

 

Don’t be snuffed out.

 

Shine.
