The flooring in the elevator at my hotel consists of 21 individual wooden boards glued together to cover the entire surface of the floor. They are arranged in a 7 x 3 configuration, but off-set as to add some variance to the seam of each row. 
 
I'm growing tired of riding the elevator up to my room. I feel like I've gone up to the fourth floor or down to the Lobby a million times now. I'm ready to go home, but I have laundry to do and the laundry room here is on the first floor. 
 
I was only expecting to be here for a week when I packed my luggage. I have to take the elevator down at least one more time to launder the clothes I brought. And then I can ride it back up for the millionth and one time when my laundry has been completed.
