It’s funny how my brain can get stuck on something and just never let it go. I don’t want to take away anything from PTSD sufferers, but I don’t how else to describe it. If I hear a hard enough “b” sound I get a flashback to what I thought was the worst night of my life.

"Based on this conversation, I think we should take some time apart."
 

My stomach has never sunken as hard and fast or into as dense of a ball as it did when I heard those words through the phone. 

"Based on this conversation, I think we should take some time apart."
 

I thought I was passed all that. I hadn’t really thought about it in a while, yet it stopped me in my tracks today out of the blue. I don’t even recall what triggered it. I only recall standing still and reliving the memory of that night. Narcissists are funny like that. Even after you take off their mask, the damage was already done. You’re still questioning yourself and avoiding your triggers that remind you of them even after they’ve long since been removed from your life.

"Based on this conversation, I think we should take some time apart."
 

But I’ve gotten better at reminding myself that nothing I learned about myself was true. Nothing I discovered about my character was actually wrong. 

 

Better now to understand that all that strife and dissonance was utter nonsense bestowed by a beast, not a beauty.

 

Better now to berate and bellow my triumph by banding together as many bonded brother b’s I can bring. Binging bottles of beer to block the brain from building does not serve the grand plan.

 

Because I will not bow. I’ll buy Brandon a bagel and barrage your backpack with books about baboons if that’s what it takes to stop cringing and spacing out when a brother brings up bouncy balls in a random conversation about being bored at batting practice for his baseball team. Their mascot is a badger. The honey badger’s I’ve seen on YouTube wouldn’t breakdown over a broken brace that held up a bookshelf full of Abba records.

"Based on this conversation, I think we should take some time apart."
 

I agree. You weren’t healthy for me. You aren’t healthy for anyone. And I’ve all but gotten myself back to center now. 

 

P.S. Billy brought back baked beans before Brandon bought bagels because Brandon blasted by Brookshire’s before boogieing by Blake’s, but Brandon bagged baked beans before Brandon began boogieing.
