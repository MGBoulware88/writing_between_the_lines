I used to complain so when it would rain. Apparently they didn’t build houses with gutters back in the ‘50s so stepping out for a smoke during a downpour required inoculation: mental preparation that my jeans would be soaked (or changing into shorts and dealing with soaked legs), putting a towel down inside the back door as to not track mud and leaves into the house, another towel to leave my shoes on to air-dry, and plenty of swearing about how inconvenient a house with no rain gutters is.

 

I used to do that. Now that I’ve been practicing and putting forth effort, I’ve learned to sing a different tune. 

 

Now when it rains I don’t freak out about my shoes getting wet - I simply slip on my Sperry’s and sanction the splash. I no longer begrudgingly berate the clouds for inconveniencing me with their blasphemous booms of thunder and their beating water bomb beads bouncing ballads off the brick - I submit to the serene song of the Saturday shower and cleansing cacophony of the cumulonimbus clouds. The personal preparation I participated in previously has progressed to the next paradigm permutation - I’m not inoculating in advance of any inconvenience inside, I’m readying my star-struck eye sockets for the second that shy star springs from it’s striped stratus screen.

 

The difference in the decision development that determines the dedication to my duty is demonstrable. 

 

Even more transfixing, through trial and tribulation I’ve usurped the tyrant and taken back the thrown.

 

How convenient that it’s raining now - I wanted to redecorate this place.

August is going to be a great month.
